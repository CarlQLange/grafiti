jqpipe-go
=========

This package is a wrapper of [JQ](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language, designed to make it easy for Go programs to filter JSON input using JQ. This is used internally at [ThreatGRID](http://threatgrid.com) to perform unit testing using [expectjq](http://github.com/threatgrid/expectjq) and as a map/reduce VM for ThreatGRID's internal data storage.

API information is available at [godoc.org](http://godoc.org/github.com/threatgrid/jqpipe-go).
