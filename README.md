## Configure aws credentials

  In order to user these tools, you will need to configure your machine to talk to aws with a `~/.aws/credentials` file.

```
 [default]
 aws_access_key_id = AKID1234567890
 aws_secret_access_key = MY-SECRET-KEY
 You can learn more about the credentials file from this blog post.
```

 Alternatively, you can set the following environment variables:

```
 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKID1234567890
 AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=MY-SECRET-KEY
```
